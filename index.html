        <h2>Sound controlled Animals</h2>     
        <p>HearAid is an NGO for people who have hearing disabilities. As the people with hearing disabilities cannot hear the surrounding noise, it's hard for them to listen to the barking of dogs from a distance, and at times, they end up having themselves in a situation where there might be a dog fight, which can be harmful for their lives. So, HearAid NGO has been looking for candidates who can build an application that displays which animal sound is coming from a distance and alerts the user so that the user stays away from such places.</p>
